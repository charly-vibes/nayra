# Handoff: [brief description]

## Context

[1-2 paragraph overview of what we're working on and why]

## Current Status

### Completed
- [x] [Task 1 with file:line references]
- [x] [Task 2 with file:line references]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Task being worked on with current state]

### Planned
- [ ] [Next task]
- [ ] [Future task]

## Critical Files

> These are the MOST IMPORTANT files to understand for continuation

1. `path/to/critical/file.ext:123-156` - Core implementation of X
2. `path/to/config.ext:45` - Configuration for Y
3. `path/to/test.ext` - Existing tests that constrain changes

## Recent Changes

> Files modified in this session

- `src/auth/oauth.ts:34-89` - Added OAuth flow orchestration
- `src/auth/providers.ts:1-134` - Created provider abstraction (new file)
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx:67-89` - Integrated OAuth UI
- `tests/oauth.test.ts:1-67` - Unit tests for OAuth (new file)

## Key Learnings

> Important discoveries that affect future work

1. **OAuth state must be stored in sessionStorage**
   - LocalStorage persists across tabs causing state confusion
   - See `src/auth/oauth.ts:45` for implementation

2. **Provider interface needs async initialization**
   - Some providers require config fetching before use
   - Current implementation in `src/auth/providers.ts:23`

3. **Existing auth system uses context pattern**
   - Must integrate OAuth without breaking existing email/password
   - See `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` for pattern

## Open Questions

> Unresolved decisions or uncertainties

- [ ] Should OAuth tokens be stored in httpOnly cookies or localStorage?
- [ ] Need to verify PKCE flow works with all providers
- [ ] How to handle provider-specific scopes?

## Next Steps

> Prioritized actions for next session

1. **Test OAuth flow end-to-end** [Priority: HIGH]
   - Test with real provider credentials
   - Verify token refresh works
   - Check error handling

2. **Add provider configuration UI** [Priority: MEDIUM]
   - Allow admin to enable/disable providers
   - Configure client IDs per environment

3. **Document OAuth setup** [Priority: MEDIUM]
   - Update README with provider setup instructions
   - Add environment variable documentation

## Notes

> Any other useful context

- Testing locally requires registered OAuth apps for each provider
- Google OAuth has strict redirect URI validation
- GitHub provider works but needs organization scope review
